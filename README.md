# Tic-Tak-Toe Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 16

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to fetch and render data using API's. The project will make use of useEffect and well as useReducer to be able to fetch data from an API. It will then use pagination to be able to render that data in a user friendly interface.

### Features

* Search bar to search any terms which will return the applicable articles.
* A page size bar which allows you to adjust the size of the page specifying that by number of articles per page
* Pagination represented by buttons below the search results

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the Data-Fetcher directory to your local machine.
A local server is needed to run the test React applications.
To do this complete the following steps:
- Download Live Server extension in VS code OR
- Download http-server via terminal using `npm install --global http-server` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- Run a new terminal window within that folder and launch the React app via `http-server -c-1` 
- `-c-1` is used to stop the page from caching
- Once is it running, you can open your browser and navigate to the following site:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080     
- To quit the application you can use `Ctrl + c`

### Expected outcomes:
Access to information at your fingertips.

## Support

If by some unexpected circumstance the data stops rendering, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap

Oh we have so many places to go...
