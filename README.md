# Tic-Tak-Toe Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 16

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to create a Tic Tac Toe game. This uses components within React.

### Features

* A board which has 9 squares
* Each player gets a turn, there will be an X and an O player. When the player clicks on a square it will mark it with the players respective symbol.
* There will be live results as well as an indicator on whose turn it is to play

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the Tic-Tac_Toe directory to your local machine.
A local server is needed to run the test React applications.
To do this complete the following steps:
- Download Live Server extension in VS code OR
- Download http-server via terminal using `npm install --global http-server` from https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- Run a new terminal window within that folder and launch the React app via `http-server -c-1` 
- `-c-1` is used to stop the page from caching
- Once is it running, you can open your browser and navigate to the following site:
    - http://127.0.0.1:8080     
- To quit the application you can use `Ctrl + c`

### Expected outcomes:
An interactive game that can be played between two players.

## Support

If by some unexpected circumstance the tic's stop tac'ing and toe'ing, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

- Add a 'Clear' button on the main board so that when it is pressed the game score as well as the marking in each block as well as the colors are reset to their original values.
